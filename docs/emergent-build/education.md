## Sleep & Neuroplasticity Highlights
- Sleep consolidates learning; pulling all-nighters undermines retention.
- Eight tracked metrics drive the Neuroplasticity Sleep Score:
  1. Duration (7–9 hours optimal)
  2. Sleep Efficiency (>85%)
  3. HRV during sleep (parasympathetic recovery)
  4. Sleep Consistency (<30 min bedtime variance)
  5. WASO (minimize wake after sleep onset)
  6. Sleep Onset Latency (fall asleep within ~15 min)
  7. Respiratory Rate (stable, moderate rate)
  8. Deep Sleep %

## In-App Messaging
- Emphasize the three-phase plasticity model (trigger, signal, consolidation).
- Reinforce relationship between post-exercise sessions and optimal windows.
- Provide actionable tips (cool bedroom, avoid late caffeine, consistent bedtime).

## Usage
- Integrate snippets into tooltips, onboarding modals, and education screens.
- Ensure references cite Huberman Lab, Walker (Why We Sleep), and other sources noted in the parent doc.
