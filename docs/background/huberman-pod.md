0:02
As we get into adulthood, most of our
0:04
neural maps in the brain, certainly our
0:06
sensory maps and our cortex, our motor
0:08
maps that allow us to move in particular
0:10
ways, those have been established. You
0:13
can still change them, but they've
0:15
mostly been established throughout
0:16
childhood and into our early 20s. And if
0:18
we want to modify those circuits with
0:20
neuroplasticity, there are a couple of
0:22
key requirements. One, you need to be
0:24
alert. You can't get neuroplasticity.
0:26
That is, you can't trigger
0:27
neuroplasticity unless you're alert. You
0:29
also have to be focused. This is
0:31
critical and differentiates adult
0:32
plasticity in a major way from
0:34
plasticity when we're young where we can
0:36
learn by passive exposure. Okay? When
0:39
we're young, we can learn by passive
0:40
exposure or even better by focused
0:43
exposure. But when we are adults, we
0:45
need alertness and we need focus. Just
0:47
passively being exposed to, you know,
0:50
music or to a motor pattern is not going
0:52
to allow us to change our nervous
0:54
system. That's been shown over and over
0:55
again. Fortunately, what also has been
0:57
shown over and over again is that if we
1:00
are alert and we're focused and we are
1:02
determined, especially if we undertake
1:03
what's called incremental learning,
1:05
where we go after small bits of
1:07
neuroplasticity repeatedly over time, we
1:10
can get as much neuroplasticity as one
1:13
observes in childhood. It just takes
1:15
longer and you have to do it so-called
1:16
incrementally.
Role of Acetylcholine in Neuroplasticity
1:18
There's a lot to say about that, but for
1:20
sake of today's discussion about the
1:22
vagus nerve, I just want to tell you
1:24
that there's a particular pathway in the
1:26
brain that involves the molecule
1:29
acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is used to
1:32
contract the muscles. It's released from
1:34
motor neurons in the spinal cord onto
1:36
muscles to contract the muscles. It's
1:38
also used in the brain and elsewhere in
1:39
the nervous system and it does a lot of
1:41
different things. It's actually involved
1:42
in generating the rhythms of the heart.
1:45
But acetylcholine released from a
1:47
particular nucleus in the brain called
1:49
nucleus basalis. The acetylcholine
1:51
released from nucleus basalis is what we
1:54
call permissive for plasticity. In other
1:56
words, if you have acetylcholine
1:58
released from nucleus basalis into the
2:00
brain, plasticity is much more likely to
2:03
occur. And in fact acetylcholine
2:06
released from nucleus basalis is sort of
2:08
like a gate whereby if you release
2:10
acetylcholine the opportunity for
2:12
neuroplasticity and learning is
2:14
available for some period of time. So
2:16
the question therefore becomes how do
2:17
you get acetylcholine released from
2:19
nucleus basalis. There are these
Methods to Enhance Acetylcholine Release
2:20
incredible experiments that have been
2:22
done by Mike Merzik and colleagues
2:24
showing that if you stimulate
2:26
nucleusalis to release acetylcholine and
2:28
you expose an animal or a human to a
2:30
particular sensory stimulus, the brain
2:32
remaps very fast according to that
2:34
experience. Just enormous amounts of
2:36
plasticity that you wouldn't observe
2:38
otherwise. There are also fortunately
2:40
experiments showing that if you
2:41
pharmacologically increase acetylcholine
2:44
that you can enhance the opportunity for
2:46
neuroplasticity. You still need to do
2:48
the learning. You still need to attempt
2:50
to learn something. You still have to
2:51
make it incremental, but the amount of
2:53
plasticity is significantly increased
2:56
when there's acetyloline released from
2:57
nucleus basalis. So in the absence of
3:01
deep brain stimulation using an
3:02
electrode, which most of you fortunately
3:04
will not experience because it requires
3:06
drilling down through the skull and
3:07
placing an electrode in basalis and
3:10
assuming that you're not taking anything
3:12
to increase acetyloline transmission to
3:14
learn, although there are ways to do
3:15
that. I've talked about that before and
3:17
I'll talk about that again in a future
3:18
podcast. Some of those ways include
3:21
supplementing with things like alphagpc
3:23
which is a precursor to acetylcholine.
Nicotine & Neuroplasticity
3:25
There are some other precursors to
3:27
acetyloline or things that stimulate the
3:28
release of acetylcholine such as
3:30
hooperine and things like that that will
3:32
open the opportunity for enhanced
3:34
plasticity for a few hours. And there is
3:37
good old nicotine. I know the word
3:39
nicotine brings to mind things like lung
3:42
cancer because for many many years, many
3:45
many people and still now smoked
3:46
nicotine in the form of cigarettes or
3:48
vaping. Both of which I think are
3:49
absolutely terrible as is dipping and
3:51
snuffing because yes, they increase
3:54
levels of nicotinic acetylcholine
3:56
receptor activation, which is just fancy
3:58
nerd speak for acetyloline transmission
4:00
in the brain is enhanced by nicotine.
4:03
But those delivery mechanisms also of
4:05
course can give you cancer in the case
4:07
of smoking, dipping, or snuffing. And
4:09
vaping, despite what you hear out there,
4:11
is absolutely terrible for your health.
4:13
I don't care what anybody says, the
4:15
evidence is starting to really pile up
4:17
that vaping is bad for you. Now, is oral
4:20
form nicotine bad for you in the form of
4:22
gum or in the form of a pouch, etc.? I
4:25
just want to say a couple of things.
4:27
One, it's extremely habit forming. Two,
4:30
it increases blood pressure. and it's a
4:33
vasoc constrictor. These drawbacks about
4:35
nicotine are real and are critical to
4:38
consider if you're going to use nicotine
4:39
as a focusing agent or a so-called
4:41
neutropic. I don't really like that
4:43
word, but if you're using nicotine as a
4:45
way to enhance cognition and enhance
4:49
neuroplasticity, you should know what
4:50
the potential drawbacks are. Most
4:52
notably, the habit forming and addicting
4:54
properties, which are very robust. Now
4:57
with that said, there are ways to
4:58
non-farmacologically stimulate the
5:01
nucleus basalis acetyloline pathway to
5:03
enhance the window for plasticity and
Non-Pharmacological Stimulation
5:05
the way to do that is you guessed it
5:08
through the vagus nerve. Studies in
5:10
healthy humans and humans who have had
5:12
for instance stroke as well as animal
5:14
studies have shown that if you stimulate
5:16
the vagus nerve electrically you
5:18
increase the level of alertness in the
5:20
brain. And part of the mechanism by
5:21
which you do that is the one I told you
5:23
about a few minutes ago. the adrenals,
5:25
vagus, locus ceruius, but also there's a
5:28
separate pathway from the NTS to nucleus
5:31
basalis that stimulates the release of
5:33
acetylcholine from nucleus basalis and
5:35
opens up the opportunity for
5:37
neuroplasticity.
5:39
This I should mention is not a small
5:41
effect. It is a rapid effect and it's
5:45
one that has allowed stroke patients for
5:47
instance to improve their motor
5:49
capabilities very quickly as compared to
5:51
when the Vegas nerve is not stimulated
5:53
or when acetyloline transmission is not
5:55
enhanced pharmacologically. And
5:57
fortunately now there are studies
5:59
starting to accumulate in animal models
6:01
and some in humans. We need more. But
Exercise & Neuroplasticity
6:04
there are some showing that if you
6:06
enhance alertness by way of activating
6:09
the vagus nerve through the mechanism
6:11
that I told you before, which is good
6:13
old-fashioned high-intensity exercise,
6:15
that in the several hours following that
6:17
exercise, there is an enhanced
6:20
opportunity for neuroplasticity. Now,
6:22
that enhanced opportunity for
6:23
neuroplasticity comes by way of two
6:26
different pathways. You already heard
6:27
about the first one, which is the locus
6:29
ceruius release of norepinephrine.
6:31
That's going to increase alertness,
6:33
which is a prerequisite for focus. And
6:36
it appears to be the case that the
6:37
release of acetylcholine from nucleus
6:39
basalis that's also triggered by this
6:42
high-intensity exercise is what allows
6:44
for that alertness to be converted into
6:47
focus. And those two things together,
6:49
alertness and focus, are the triggers
6:51
for adult neuroplasticity. If you think
6:54
about this, this is really exciting. For
6:56
25 years or more, we've known that
6:58
plasticity is possible in the adult
7:00
human. We knew you needed alertness and
7:02
you needed focus. We also, by the way,
Importance of Sleep
7:04
know that you need to get great sleep
7:06
that night and in subsequent nights in
7:09
order to actually allow the plasticity
7:10
to occur. Plasticity is a process. It's
7:13
not just triggered when you go about
7:14
trying to learn something. It actually
7:16
takes place in sleep as well as
7:18
sleep-like states like non-sleep, deep
7:20
rest, and meditation. But especially in
7:23
deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
7:25
This is why you can attempt to learn
7:26
something cognitively or behaviorally
7:28
over and over and over. you can't get
7:30
those scales on the piano right. You
7:32
can't get the, you know, the information
7:34
dialed in from your class, a language
7:36
class or from engineering or you're
7:39
trying to figure out what this picture
7:40
should be in your mind that you're going
7:42
to paint, etc. You work at it, you work
7:44
at it, you work at it, you sleep, you
7:46
sleep, and then one day you wake up and
7:47
suddenly you have the skill. It's
7:49
because the actual rewiring of those
7:51
circuits that we call neuroplasticity
7:53
occurs during sleep, but it's triggered
7:55
in those moments of incremental learning
7:57
and really struggling. And keep in mind
7:58
the struggle to learn something. That
8:00
friction is part of the neuroplasticity
8:03
process. And it's oh so clear now that
8:07
alertness and focus are the
8:08
prerequisites for plasticity. That
8:10
alertness is coming in large part by way
8:13
of the release of norepinephrine from
8:15
locuser. That the focus is being
8:17
augmented and perhaps even originating
8:20
entirely from the release of
8:21
acetylcholine and nucleus basalis. that
8:23
acts as sort of a spotlight on a
8:25
particular set of things that are
8:26
happening while we're trying to learn
8:29
and then that triggers the plasticity
8:31
process which takes place during sleep.
8:34
So that beautiful picture of
8:36
self-directed adaptive plasticity in
8:38
adulthood is allowed to happen because
8:43
the vagus nerve in part is triggering
8:47
NTS to say hey locus ceruleius nucleus
8:50
basalis wake up release norepinephrine
8:53
release acetylcholine now's the time to
8:55
learn. So, what this means is if you're
Practical Tips for Enhancing Neuroplasticity
8:58
struggling to learn, if you want to
8:59
continue to have robust neuroplasticity,
9:01
if you happen to have some damage to
9:04
motor pathways or you're having trouble
9:05
with focusing and brain fog, keep in
9:07
mind focus itself is served by a circuit
9:11
that is subject to plasticity, you can
9:12
actually get better at focusing by
9:15
working on focus just the same way you
9:16
would on any skill. And so if you're
9:19
struggling with focus, I highly
9:21
recommend finding a threshold of
9:22
exercise that stimulates brain alertness
9:25
that triggers these pathways that are
9:27
now starting to be clear that they occur
9:30
from the literature in animals and
9:32
humans. And yes, you might augment this
9:34
with something like caffeine, which will
9:36
further increase levels of
9:38
norepinephrine. You might even use
9:39
lowdose nicotine. I'm not necessarily
9:41
recommending that, certainly not for
9:42
young people. And you do need to be
9:44
aware of the habit forming aka addictive
9:47
properties of nicotine. You definitely
9:48
don't want to consume it in any form
9:50
that's going to cause you to increase
9:52
your risk of cancer or popcorn lung from
9:54
vaping. You could use pharmarmacology.
9:56
You could use alpha GPC. You could use
9:58
herine in combination with exercise.
10:01
However, I strongly strongly recommend
10:04
that anyone who's interested in lifelong
10:06
learning, think about organizing your
10:08
bouts of learning, especially cognitive
10:10
learning, to come in the two to three
10:12
hours, maybe even four hours, but
10:14
certainly in the 1 to two hours after
10:16
you do some sort of exercise that
10:17
doesn't leave you exhausted, but leaves
10:19
you with elevated levels of energy in
10:22
your body. So, you don't want to take
10:24
this physical exercise that I'm talking
10:26
about to exhaustion because that's going
10:28
to leave you depleted. that's going to
10:29
cause a you know uptick in
10:31
parasympathetic activity. Any of you
10:33
that have done a hard leg workout and
10:35
then you know 2 three hours later you're
10:37
just like it's very clear brain oxygen
10:39
levels are down parasympathetic activity
10:41
is up you are tired because you
10:43
exhausted all that energy and exercise.
10:45
But if you can use exercise as a trigger
10:47
to release adrenaline and stimulate
10:49
these pathways within the brain that
10:51
arrive via the signaling from the vagus,
10:53
you do indeed open up the opportunity
10:55
for enhanced neuroplasticity at any age.
