## The Science in Plain English

### What Happens When You Sleep?

**Think of sleep as your brain's cleanup and filing system.**

When you learn something new during the day:
1. Your brain marks it as "important" (if you were focused and alert)
2. During sleep, it moves that information from temporary storage (hippocampus) to permanent storage (cortex)
3. It also clears out metabolic waste that built up during the day

**This is why pulling an all-nighter before an exam backfires** - you never filed the information properly. The learning didn't "stick" because consolidation requires sleep.

## Why We Track 8 Sleep Metrics

Your sleep score isn't just about how long you slept. Research shows that **sleep quality matters just as much as quantity** for memory consolidation and neuroplasticity. Here's what we track and why:

---

### 1. Sleep Duration (30% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** Total time you were actually asleep (not just in bed)

**Optimal:** 7-9 hours

**Why it matters:**
- Your brain needs time to complete memory consolidation
- Each sleep cycle (~90 min) processes different types of learning
- Short sleep (<6h) = incomplete filing system
- **Every 2-hour reduction** in sleep results in **60-80% reduction in REM sleep** (where emotional and procedural memories consolidate)

**What you can do:**
- Set a consistent bedtime to ensure 7-8 hours in bed
- Track your wake-up feeling: groggy = probably need more sleep
- Use sleep calculator: If you need to wake at 6 AM, go to bed by 10:30 PM

**Science says:** "Sleep duration is the primary determinant of consolidation window duration." - Matthew Walker, *Why We Sleep* (2017)

---

### 2. Sleep Efficiency (25% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** Percentage of time in bed that you're actually asleep

**Optimal:** >85%

**Example:** If you're in bed 8 hours but only sleep 7 hours, your efficiency is 87.5%

**Why it matters:**
- Lying awake in bed disrupts the filing process
- Frequent wake-ups fragment consolidation
- Low efficiency = your brain keeps getting interrupted mid-task

**What you can do:**
- **Only go to bed when sleepy** (not just tired)
- If awake >20 min, get up and do something calming (read, gentle stretching)
- Avoid screens 1 hour before bed (blue light suppresses melatonin)
- Keep bedroom cool (60-67°F), dark, and quiet

**Science says:** "Efficiency >85% correlates with better subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance." - Ohayon et al. (2017)

---

### 3. HRV During Sleep (10% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** Heart Rate Variability - how much your heart rate changes between beats during sleep

**Optimal:** 60-80 ms RMSSD (for age 30)

**Why it matters:**
- **High HRV during sleep = your nervous system is in "recovery mode"**
- Explains **70% of variance** in overnight memory improvement (research from 2025)
- Low HRV = stressed/overtrained, less effective consolidation
- HRV reflects parasympathetic ("rest and digest") dominance

**What you can do:**
- Avoid intense exercise <3 hours before bed
- Manage stress during the day (meditation, deep breathing)
- Stay cool while sleeping (60-67°F optimal)
- Reduce evening alcohol (blocks parasympathetic recovery)
- Consider magnesium glycinate supplement (200-400mg before bed)

**Note:** Requires Apple Watch or Oura Ring

**Science says:** "Vagal HRV during REM reduces negative memory bias and enhances positive memory consolidation." - Frontiers in Neuroscience (2025)

---

### 4. Sleep Consistency (10% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** How much your bedtime varies from night to night (measured over 7 days)

**Optimal:** <30 min variation

**Example:** If you go to bed at 10:30 PM most nights, but stay up until midnight on Friday, your consistency suffers.

**Why it matters:**
- Your brain works on a 24-hour clock (circadian rhythm)
- Consistent bedtime = stronger hormonal signals for consolidation
- Erratic schedule = "social jet lag" effect, weaker memory
- **Accounts for 25% of academic performance variance** (bigger predictor than total sleep duration!)

**What you can do:**
- Go to bed within 30 min of same time **every night, even weekends**
- Use "Wind Down" alarm on iPhone (1 hour before bedtime)
- Track your consistency score in the app
- If shift worker: Select "shift schedule" mode in settings

**Science says:** "Irregular sleep/wake patterns associated with 0.65 GPA point reduction (B+ to B-)." - Phillips et al., *Scientific Reports* (2017)

---

### 5. WASO - Wake After Sleep Onset (10% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** Total time you're awake during the night (after initially falling asleep)

**Optimal:** <30 min

**Example:** You fall asleep at 10:30 PM, but wake up at 2 AM for 15 min and 4 AM for 10 min = 25 min WASO

**Why it matters:**
- Waking up interrupts the filing process
- Each wake-up restarts the consolidation cycle
- **Every 30-minute increase** in WASO = measurable cognitive decline

**What you can do:**
- Limit fluids 2 hours before bed (reduce bathroom trips)
- Keep bedroom **cool** (overheating causes wake-ups)
- Keep bedroom **dark** (use blackout curtains, cover LEDs)
- Address sleep apnea if suspected (check respiratory rate metric)
- Avoid large meals close to bedtime

**Science says:** "WASO fragments consolidation windows and interrupts sleep spindle generation." - Scullin (2019)

---

### 6. Sleep Onset Latency (5% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** Time it takes to fall asleep after getting in bed

**Optimal:** 10-20 min

**Why it matters:**
- **<5 min = you're sleep deprived** (falling asleep instantly isn't good)
- **>30 min = insomnia or circadian misalignment**
- Sweet spot (10-20 min) = healthy sleep pressure

**What you can do:**
- If falling asleep <5 min consistently → **get more sleep** (go to bed earlier)
- If taking >30 min → **move bedtime later** (sleep restriction technique)
- Build a bedtime routine (same sequence nightly trains your brain)
- Try 4-7-8 breathing: Inhale 4 sec, hold 7 sec, exhale 8 sec

**Science says:** "SOL 10-20 min indicates optimal circadian alignment and sleep pressure." - Ohayon et al. (2000)

---

### 7. Respiratory Rate (5% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** Breaths per minute while sleeping

**Optimal:** 12-16 bpm

**Why it matters:**
- **>20 bpm or <10 bpm = possible sleep apnea**
- Sleep apnea fragments sleep, blocks consolidation
- Regular breathing pattern supports slow-oscillation coupling (memory mechanism)

**What you can do:**
- If consistently abnormal → **talk to doctor** (sleep study recommended)
- Sleep on side (not back) if snoring
- Maintain healthy weight
- Avoid evening alcohol (relaxes throat muscles)

**Note:** Requires Apple Watch

**Science says:** "Respiration modulates sleep oscillations critical for memory reactivation." - Nature Communications (2023)

---

### 8. Deep Sleep Percent (5% of your sleep score)

**What it is:** Percentage of total sleep in deep (slow-wave) sleep

**Optimal:** >15%

**Why it matters:**
- **Deep sleep = when most memory filing happens**
- Also when brain clears metabolic waste (glymphatic system)
- Slow waves coordinate hippocampal-cortical memory transfer

**What you can do:**
- Get deep sleep early in night (go to bed on time, don't delay)
- **Avoid alcohol** (blocks deep sleep, even one drink)
- Exercise during day (increases deep sleep at night)
- Keep bedroom cool (cold temperatures promote deep sleep)

**Science says:** "Deep sleep drives slow-wave activity and memory replay essential for consolidation." - Stickgold (2005)

## How to Improve Your Sleep Score

### Quick Wins (Do These First)

**1. Consistent bedtime (±30 min)** - Biggest impact on score
- Pick a bedtime and stick to it, even weekends
- Set a "Wind Down" reminder 1 hour before

**2. 7-8 hours in bed** - Calculate backward from wake time
- Need to wake at 6 AM? Be in bed by 10:30 PM (allows 7.5h sleep)

**3. Cool, dark bedroom** - Optimize environment
- Temperature: 60-67°F
- Blackout curtains or sleep mask
- Cover all LED lights

**4. No screens 1h before bed** - Blue light blocks melatonin
- Read a book instead
- Use "Night Shift" mode if you must use phone
- Better: charge phone outside bedroom

---

### Advanced Optimization

**5. Morning sunlight** - Sets circadian rhythm
- Get outside within 1 hour of waking
- 10-30 min of sunlight (even cloudy day helps)

**6. Exercise timing** - Morning or afternoon (not evening)
- Finish workouts 3+ hours before bed
- Exception: Gentle yoga is okay before bed

**7. Limit caffeine after 2 PM** - 6-hour half-life
- Caffeine at 4 PM = still 50% active at 10 PM
- Switch to decaf or herbal tea in afternoon

**8. Magnesium glycinate** - Supports parasympathetic recovery
- 200-400mg before bed
- Helps with HRV and deep sleep
- Consult doctor first

**9. Temperature regulation** - Cool bedroom, warm bath
- Hot bath/shower 1-2 hours before bed (causes temperature drop after)
- Sleep in cool room with warm blankets

---

### Track & Adjust

**Weekly Review:**
1. Check your sleep score each morning
2. Identify your **top negative drivers** (app shows these)
3. Make **one change** at a time (don't overwhelm yourself)
4. Reassess after 7 days
5. Repeat

**Example:**
- Week 1 negative driver: Consistency
  - Action: Set bedtime alarm for 10 PM every night
  - Result: Consistency improved from SD 45 min → SD 20 min
- Week 2 negative driver: HRV
  - Action: Reduce evening screen time, add magnesium
  - Result: HRV improved from 52 ms → 62 ms

## Understanding Your Sleep Score

### Score Ranges

**85-100: Excellent**
- Optimal neuroplasticity consolidation
- Yesterday's learning is being filed properly
- **Keep doing what you're doing!**
- Your brain is getting exactly what it needs

**70-84: Good**
- Solid consolidation, room for improvement
- Most learning is sticking, but not optimally

**50-69: Moderate**
- Consolidation is happening, but suboptimal
- Likely missing out on some learning retention
- Review "Quick Wins" above
- Prioritize sleep improvements this week

**Below 50: Poor**
- Consolidation severely impaired
- **Prioritize sleep before adding more learning**
- Learning attempts may not stick
- Consider talking to doctor if chronic

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: I only got 6 hours but my score is 80. Is that okay?**

A: Short-term, yes - you're being "saved" by other metrics (high efficiency, good HRV, etc.). But duration is 30% of your score. **Chronic short sleep (<7h) will catch up with you.** Your body is compensating now, but it's not sustainable.

---

**Q: Why is my score low when I slept 9 hours?**

A: **Check efficiency and WASO.** Lying in bed ≠ quality sleep. If you're in bed 10 hours but only sleep 8 hours (80% efficiency), that's fragmented sleep. Also check consistency - did you shift your schedule on the weekend?

---

**Q: I don't have an Apple Watch. Can I still use this?**

A: Yes! The **base formula works without HRV.** You'll get 80% of the value. The score will focus on:
- Duration (35%)
- Efficiency (30%)
- Consistency (15%)
- WASO (10%)
- Sleep Onset (5%)
- Respiratory Rate (5%)

Upgrade to Apple Watch later for HRV-enhanced scoring (explains 70% of memory variance!).

---

**Q: My respiratory rate is often 18-20 bpm. Should I worry?**

A: If **persistent** (>3 weeks), talk to your doctor about a sleep study. Could indicate sleep apnea (treatable with CPAP or oral appliance). Not an emergency, but worth checking.

---

**Q: Does napping hurt my score?**

A: Naps **don't count** toward your nightly score (we only track sleep >3 hours starting between 6 PM - 2 AM). But long naps (>90 min) can reduce sleep pressure at night, potentially lowering efficiency and increasing sleep onset latency.

**Best practice:** Keep naps <30 min (before 2 PM).

---

**Q: I'm a shift worker with an irregular schedule. What do I do?**

A: Select **"Shift Schedule" mode** in settings. The app will:
- Adjust consistency optimal ranges for your shift pattern
- Not penalize schedule changes that match your work schedule
- Still track other metrics (duration, efficiency, HRV, WASO)

Consistency is harder for shift workers, but the other metrics still matter!

---

**Q: My score is great (90+) but I still feel tired. Why?**

A: Sleep score measures **consolidation potential**, not subjective energy. Possible reasons:
1. **Medical issue** (thyroid, anemia, sleep disorder not detected by metrics)
2. **Sleep inertia** (grogginess after waking - passes within 30 min)
3. **Chronotype mismatch** (night owl forced to wake early)
4. **Stress/mental load** (even with great sleep, high stress reduces energy)

If persistent, see a doctor.

---

**Q: Can I "catch up" on sleep on weekends?**

A: **Partially**, but not fully. You can reduce sleep debt, but:
- Sleeping in disrupts your consistency (hurts consolidation)
- Better approach: Go to bed 1 hour earlier on weeknights
- Weekend catch-up should be <2 hours later than weekday wake time

**Best practice:** Consistent schedule 7 days/week.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the difference between HRV-enabled and base formula?**

A: **HRV-enabled formula** (requires Apple Watch):
- 8 components including HRV during sleep
- More accurate consolidation prediction
- Explains 70% of memory variance

**Base formula** (iPhone only):
- 6 components (no HRV, no deep sleep %)
- Still validated, just less precise
- Weights redistributed to other metrics

Both are research-backed. HRV-enabled is just more comprehensive.

---

**Q: How is consistency calculated?**

A: **Standard deviation of bedtimes over last 7 nights.**

Example:
- Monday-Thursday: 10:30 PM (±5 min)
- Friday: 12:30 AM (2 hours late)
- Saturday: 1:00 AM
- Sunday: 11:00 PM

Your SD = ~45 min → Score ~55/100

If you kept all nights within 30 min → SD ~12 min → Score 100/100

---

**Q: Why does HRV matter so much?**

A: **HRV during sleep = nervous system recovery.**

High HRV → Strong parasympathetic ("rest and digest") activity → Better memory consolidation

Research shows it explains **70% of variance in overnight memory improvement**. That's huge!

Low HRV → Sympathetic ("fight or flight") still active → Poor recovery → Weak consolidation

---

**Q: What if I'm taking sleep medication?**

A: Sleep aids (Ambien, Benadryl, etc.) may **alter sleep architecture**:
- Often reduce deep sleep and REM
- May improve efficiency but lower quality
- Score will reflect this

The app will still calculate your score accurately. We recommend:
1. Track your score on and off medication (work with doctor)
2. Use score to assess if medication is helping or hurting
3. Don't adjust scoring algorithm - it's showing real sleep quality

## Sleep & Learning Connection

### How Sleep Score Affects Next-Day Learning

**Your sleep score predicts:**
1. **Baseline cognitive state** (alertness, focus capacity)
2. **Learning readiness** (how well your brain can form new memories)
3. **Consolidation capacity** (how well today's learning will stick tonight)

**If your sleep score is:**
- **85-100:** Full learning capacity - schedule deep work today
- **70-84:** Good capacity - can learn effectively
- **50-69:** Reduced capacity - stick to easier tasks, review material
- **<50:** Impaired - prioritize sleep recovery, delay hard learning

---

### The Virtuous Cycle

**Good Sleep → Better Learning → Better Sleep → Better Learning...**

1. **Last night's good sleep** → Strong focus during today's learning session
2. **Today's focused learning** → Creates consolidation work for tonight
3. **Tonight's good sleep** → Files today's learning + prepares for tomorrow
4. **Tomorrow's session** → Builds on yesterday's consolidated knowledge

**Break the cycle** with even one bad night → Consolidation incomplete → Learning less effective → Stress increases → Sleep worsens

**This is why consistency matters so much.**

## Related: Session Analysis

**Your sleep score affects your Learning Readiness Index (LRI).**

Poor sleep last night → Lower baseline LRI today → Harder to get into optimal learning state

Great sleep last night → Higher baseline LRI → Easier to reach peak focus

**Check your LRI before starting a deep learning session.** If it's low due to poor sleep, consider:
1. Rescheduling to post-exercise window (when LRI peaks)
2. Doing easier review tasks instead of hard learning
3. Taking a 20-min nap to boost baseline
