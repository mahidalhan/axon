# Data Pipeline Guide

This directory documents the end-to-end cleaning pipelines for the datasets feeding the Brain Score MVP. Use these specs when preparing data for Emergent’s automated FastAPI/backend build.

- `muse-eeg.md` – cleaning Muse Subconscious Decisions dataset into session-ready CSV/Parquet.
- `apple-health.md` – extracting enhanced sleep metrics from Apple Health export XML.
- `outputs.md` – expected file formats and directory structure delivered to Emergent.
