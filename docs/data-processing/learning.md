Key concepts:

A window is a 30 second period of time ( a time slice of a continuous stream of EEG data). Each window is a 30 second period of time. The muse headband records 256 samples per second, so each window is 7,680 samples.

HSI (HEADBAND SIGNAL INDEX) is a measure of the quality of the EEG data in a window.
HSI is made of impedance values for each electrode in the window, signal to noise ratio, signal stability, and artifact detection.

Artifacts are events that are not part of the user's natural brain activity. They are typically caused by the user's body moving or by external noise. Artifact detection prevents garbage data from poisoning your metrics. Like detecting blinks or jaw clenches, and removing them from the data. 

LRI (LEARNING READINESS INDEX) is a measure of the learning readiness of the user in a window.

DNOS (DAILY NEUROPLASTICITY OPTIMIZATION SCORE) is a measure of the neuroplasticity of the user in a window.

Brain Score is a measure of the overall neuroplasticity of the user.
